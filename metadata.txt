name=Vector Tiles Reader
qgisMinimumVersion=2.18
qgisMaximumVersion=3.98
description=Reader (short VT reader) which reads Vector Tiles from various predefined and configurable sources
about=Plugin which reads vector tiles according to Mapbox' Vector Tiles specification as QGIS layers in a group. Styled vector tiles are typically used as high quality base maps. Sources can be an internet server, an MBTiles file or a directory of files. If an Mapbox GL JSON style is configured, the style is (partially) converted to QGIS styles.
    The plugin has connections already configured for the following providers:
    * OpenMapTiles.com with OSM Bright MB GL style (default)
    * Nextzen.org
    This Python plugin uses prebuilt C++ binaries for performance reasons.
